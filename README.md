LIST COMPREHENSIONS
You are given three integers x, y, z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j, k)  on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k  is not equal to n. Here, . Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.
